# UpdateTimeSheets  

This application was designed for specific use by an employee at a company in order to update their yearly timesheet.  
NOTE: The code has been designed to only work on a semimonthly payroll schedule.  
  
## Installation  
You'll only need the `.jar` file included with the `.zip` file you download from this repo. Simply download the `.jar` file and run it from wherever you downloaded it to.  
  
## How To Use
After opening the application, you'll see a textbox and a couple buttons. The textbox is for entering the year that you want the timesheets to cover. After typing in the year, press `Submit year`. If you try to click `Browse` before submitting your year, it will not work.  

After submitting the year, you're good to go ahead and click "Browse". After specifying where the excel file is that you'd like to update, the program will run and display a message: `Speadsheet successfully updated`

## Features to Add
Ideally, I'd like to add more options for pay periods. Also the ability to change the pay periods based on an inputted pay date. As of now, the application calculates the pay date based off the last day in the pay period.
